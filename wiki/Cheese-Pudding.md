==Ingredients==

* 100g / 4 oz. breadcrumbs
* 400ml milk
* 25g / 1 oz butter
* 2-3 eggs
* 200g / 8 oz. grated cheddar or Gruyere cheese
* 1 tsp mustard (optional)
* salt and pepper

==Directions==

# Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F
# Place the breadcrumbs into a large bowl.
# Warm the milk with the butter until the butter melts, then pour the mixture over the breadcrumbs and leave to stand for 10 minutes. Most of the milk will be absorbed by that time.
# Beat the eggs with a little salt and then whisk into the breadcrumbs.
# Stir in the cheese before adding the salt, pepper and mustard (if using) to taste.
# Turn the mixture out into a shallow baking dish and smooth the top.
# Bake for 30-35mins in the centre of the oven until golden and nicely risen, and with the tiniest bit of wobble.
