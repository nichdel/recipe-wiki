==Ingredients==

*    6 cups Chex cereal
*    1 cup light corn syrup
*    1 cup sugar
*    1½ cups peanut butter
*    2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips
*    2 cups butterscotch chips
*    ½ cup peanut butter
*    1 teaspoon vanilla

==Directions==

# Line a baking sheet with wax paper 
# In a small saucepan, combine the corn syrup and sugar over medium heat. Once boiling, immediately remove from heat and stir in 1½ cups of peanut butter. 
# Pour over cereal and fold together. 
# Use a large cookie scoop to drop cereal onto wax paper, and use your hands to press together and form them.
# Using a microwave safe dish or a double boiler, melt together chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, ½ cup of peanut butter and vanilla. 
# If microwaving, heat in 10 second intervals, stirring in between to prevent the chocolate from burning.
# Once smooth, pour over cereal, or scoop onto the piles you have created.
# Allow to cool completely at room temperature.
