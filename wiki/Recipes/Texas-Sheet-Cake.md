# Chocolate Pecan Frosting:
    1 stick dairy-free margarine (1/2 cup)
    ¼ cup cocoa powder
    2 – 3 tablespoons soy milk
    1 teaspoon vanilla
    3 – 4 cups powdered sugar
    ½ cup chopped pecans (plus more if you’d like to put on top for a nice touch)

# Directions


1. Heat your oven to 350F. Prepare your sheet cake pan by giving it a quick spray of vegetable cooking spray.

2. In a saucepan, melt the coconut spread over medium heat. Add the cocoa and stir until well combined. In a separate, small sauce pan, heat the water until it’s good and hot. Add the hot water, stir, and bring that mixture to a boil for 20-30 seconds. Then remove from heat.
3 In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda.

3. In a separate, smaller bowl combine the soy buttermilk, whipped tofu, and vanilla and stir well. Set aside.

4. Now comes the fun part. Pour the hot chocolate mixture over the flour mixture and stir well. Then fold in the soy buttermilk mixture and stir until everything is well-combined. Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan. Bake for 20 – 25 minutes.

5. We will be icing the cake while it is still warm so go ahead and make the frosting while the cake is baking. Melt the margarine in a saucepan (I used the same one from the cake…didn’t even bother to rinse it out since the ingredients are so similar) over medium heat. Add the cocoa. Is this sounding familiar?

6. Remove from heat and add the soy milk and vanilla. Stir until combined. Now add the powdered sugar. I add it one cup at a time, giving it a good stir between each cup to work out any lumps from the powdered sugar and to make sure I get the right consistency with the frosting. Add the chopped pecans, stir together, and then sit by the oven waiting for the cake to finally get done. It may add some drama if you act annoyed at how long it’s taking. The kiddos will laugh if you throw in a few exasperated facial expressions too.

7. Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and pour the prepared frosting evenly over the still warm cake. Let the heat help you spread that frosting out all the way through from the far corners of the cake. You want every bite to know there’s frosting involved. And pecans. Make sure those are evenly distributed as well. Or add some finely chopped pecans to the top to really wow your guests!
