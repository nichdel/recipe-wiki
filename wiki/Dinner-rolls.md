Ingredients

    2 Tbsp organic cane sugar
    1/2 tsp sea salt
    1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) rapid ride yeast
    2 cups unbleached all purpose flour (sub up to 1/3 with whole wheat pastry), plus more for kneading
    1/2 cup unsweetened plain almond milk
    1/4 cup water
    2 Tbsp vegan butter + more for topping

Instructions

    In a large mixing bowl, combine 3/4 cup flour, yeast, sugar and salt.
    In a separate mixing bowl (or small saucepan over medium heat), microwave the water, almond milk and butter until warm - about 110 - 120 degrees (~55 seconds). It should be the temperature of bath water. If itâ€™s too hot, it can kill the yeast.
    Add wet to the dry ingredients and whisk or beat for 2 minutes, scraping sides as needed.
    Add 1/4 cup more flour and beat for another 2 minutes. Then, add only enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Then let rest 10 minutes.
    Divide the dough into 12 pieces, shape into balls, and place in a greased 8x8 dish or 8-inch round pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size - about 30-45 minutes.
    Preheat oven to 375 degrees and brush the tops with additional melted vegan butter (optional). Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until fluffy and light golden brown.
