# Preheat oven to 350. 
# Combine oats, salt, flour, and honey in a large bowl.

# Mix in blackberries and chopped pine nuts. 
# Form balls using a  cookie scoop or by hand and flatten the rounds with the palm of your hand, so that they are no thicker than 1/4 inch and place on cookie sheet (My oatcakes were the size of a regular oatmeal cookie when placed on the cookie sheet).
