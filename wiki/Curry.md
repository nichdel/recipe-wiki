===Ingredients===
* cooked rice (enough so each person will get one 3/4 cup serving per bowl)

* hard boiled eggs (if desired one for each bowl)

* 4 large potatoes

* 2 sticks butter

* 3-4 spoonfuls flour

* 1-1 1/2 L water

* 1 palmful of curry powder

* 1 palmful of chili Powder

* 1 palmful of paprika

* 1 small palmful black pepper

* 1 large can or 2 regular sized cans of tuna


===Instructions===

# Fill a large pot about 1/2 way with water and set it to boil on the stove.
# Chop potatoes into bite sized pieces and boil until tender enough to bite easily
# In a large skillet cut butter into small pieces and melt once melted add enough flour to create a paste. Let this paste heat to golden, takes about 1 minute.
# Gradually whisk water into the paste by adding about a half cup at a time. The amount of water you use will depend on if you want a thick, gravy-like curry (less water) or a thinner, soup-like curry (more water).
# Once all water has been added add curry powder (more for more spice, less for a more subtle taste) pepper, and tuna. Stir well.
# Stir well and keep over heat to allow to thicken, here the amount of water you add can determine if the curry is thicker or thinner.
# Stir together the curry sauce and the potatoes.
# Serve curry over rice and cut up a hard boiled egg on top  if desired.
