==Ingredients==
*   1 cup dry pot barley
*   1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
*   1/2 tsp dried oregano
*   1/2 tsp dried basil
*   1 large garlic clove, minced
*   15 oz canned pureed/diced tomatoes
*   1 cup milk
*   1/2 cup water
*   1/4 cup nutritional yeast 
*   1/2 tbsp Miso, mixed with 1/2 tbsp water
*   1/4-1/2 tsp kosher salt, to taste

==Directions==
# Rinse pot barley in a strainer and place into medium sized pot that has a lid. Add olive oil, basil, and oregano and stir well until barley is coated with oil. Turn heat to medium until barley begins to sizzle.

# Once the barley sizzles, add in the minced garlic and reduce heat to low-medium. Cook for 1 minute and then add in the tomatoes, milk, water, nutritional yeast, miso, and salt. Stir well and bring to a gentle boil and then cover and reduce heat to low.

# Cook, covered (with a bit of air escaping) for 30-35 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so, being careful not to burn the barley on the bottom of the pot.
