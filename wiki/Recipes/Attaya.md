Instructions
------------

1.  Fill a small teapot to the bottom of the spout's inside opening with the tea.
2.  Add the leaves from three sprigs of mint to the teapot.
3.  Fill with water to the top of the spout's inside opening.
4.  Bring to a boil slowly.
5.  Pour the tea into a cup.
6.  Pour the tea from the cup into the other cup in a sweeping-up-the-down motion. A successful sweeping motion will make a layer of foam on top of the tea.
7.  Repeat 5-10 times, until you can't get more foam.
8.  Pour back into the pot along with an extra cup of water.
9.  Bring back to a boil.
10. Pour sugar into one cup, filling it 4/5ths of the way.
11. Pour the tea into the sugar-cup.
12. Pour the sugar-cup into the other cup.
13. Pour more tea into the sugar-cup, and pour the other cup back into the pot.
14. Do this until the sugar is 3/4ths gone, then fill the sugar-cup halfway with water and pour that into the pot.
15. Boil again.
16. Repeat steps 5-7 but do it 10-20 times.
17. Serve half a cup to each person.
18. Repeat steps 3-17 two more times.
