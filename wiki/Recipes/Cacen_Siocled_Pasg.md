===Ingredients===

==For the Cake:== 

* 175g margarine, softened 
* 175g caster sugar 
* 3 eggs 175g 
* self-raising flour 
* 25g cocoa powder 
* 50g ground almonds 

==For the Filling:==
* 225g chocolate (at least 70% cocoa solids) 
* 50g butter 
* 300ml double cream 

===Directions===
# Cream together the margarine and sugar until pale and fluffy then add the eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly to combine after each addition. 
# Sift the flour into a bowl then fold into the creamed mixture, along with the cocoa powder and ground almonds. 
# Thoroughly grease a 20cm diameter springform cake tin. Turn in the cake mix and even out the top. 
# Transfer to an oven pre-heated to 180°C (350°F) and bake for 50 minutes, or until the cake is cooked through and a skewer inserted into the centre emerges cleanly. 
# Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 10 minutes then tun out onto a wire rack to cool completely. 
# When cold, use a sharp knife to slice the cake through the middle into two equal rounds. 
# For the filling, combine the chocolate, butter, and cream in a small saucepan. Heat very gently, stirring frequently, until the butter and chocolate have melted and combined with the cream. 
# Beat with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes then turn the mixture into a bowl and set aside to cool until the mixture begins to set. 
# Now use the chocolate cream to sandwich the two cake halves together.
